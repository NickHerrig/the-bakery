# The Bakery

## Introduction

The Bakery is a cluster of 4 Raspberry Pi computers originally created for learning:

- Networking concepts
- Load balancing applications
- Multi-Server application deployment
- Distributed infrastructure configuration management

The Bakery was originally inspired by Jeff Gerling and his Raspberry Pi [Dramble](https://www.pidramble.com/).

## Initial Setup
Below is the description of my hardware.
Depending on your project goal and what you want to learn, this may look a lot different!

### Hardware

- 4 Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- 4 32 GB micro SD cards 
- 4 micro USB cables 
- 4 Ethernet cables 
- 1 Ethernet switch 

### Operating System

Although I'm consistently playing around with different operating systems like:

- Chrome OS
- Debian
- Raspbian
- Kali
- Mint
- Gentoo

My current favorite is Ubuntu.
In my humble opinion, I believe it is the most well documented, and easiest to work with OS!
I downloaded an Ubuntu Server image for the pi the on their [site](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)
That site also has some great info on which version/flavor you should go with.
